## Adding pedestrians, targets and obstacles

Currently our implementation allows for the creation of new scenarios using the GUI. These scenarios can then besaved and loaded later. However, task 1 seems to imply that our program should be able to add elements (pedestrians, targets or obstacles) on the fly during a simulation (maybe by clicking an `Add Pedestrian` button and then clicking on the grid).
Is this necessary?

## Time Step

Currently the simulator can run manually step by step (using the provided step button). However, the language used in task 1 make it seem that a time step simulation (that takes a step every 0.5 seconds for example) is the goal. 
Is this true?
